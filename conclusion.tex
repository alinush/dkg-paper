\section{Conclusion}

We introduced new techniques that both speed up and scale threshold cryptosystems.
First, we showed how computing Lagrange coefficients efficiently can drastically reduce threshold signature aggregation time.
We believe our fast BLS threshold signature scheme can be used to design simple, large-scale, decentralized random beacons.
Second, we introduced a quasilinear time technique for precomputing proofs in KZG polynomial commitments.
When applied to VSS and DKG protocols, this technique drastically reduces computation without increasing communication too much.
We left scaling the broadcast channel and the complaint round to future work.
